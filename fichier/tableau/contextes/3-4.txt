Niparko told me the sooner we implant, the faster the results. Not

Unfortunately, Dr Dana Suskind at UC/Comer Children’s only
implants pediatric patients. If you get implanted in another
city, then Yes, you can be MAPped locally; however switch-on

were implanted, especially if there are any “issues.”
