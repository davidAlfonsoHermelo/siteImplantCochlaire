for CLARITY.

In her signature high pitch singsong voice, she exclaimed, “Look at my
mom’s COCH-LE-AR IMPLANT!”
And you know what I realized?  She’s proud of me.
After years of worrying that my situation would somehow embarrass my
kids, Claire looks at my cochlear implant as some kind of badge of
honor.  In fact, sometimes when I’m not wearing the processor, I catch

eems my cochlear implant’s functionality is compromised during cold
and flu season.  For me, a simple cold now coexists with head pressure
urrounding my implant site, and more annoyingly, a constant buzzing

known as tinnitus, also known as “ringing of the ears.”  Some people
have this without being hearing impaired or having an implant, and it’s
my understanding that deaf or not, it sucks for everyone.

to see what he would sound like without the implant.
He wasn’t clear.  And he wasn’t loud.  I had no clue what he was
aying.
It would be a disservice to the implant not to acknowledge its value to
me when I’m attending presentations and lectures.  In that setting, and

the implant, I choose for my days to be merry and bright.   I wish the
