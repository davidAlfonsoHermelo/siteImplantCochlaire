Advanced Bionics has been able to issue a total reliability report. For
the implant, it is at 99.5 on June 2008 and for the Harmony processor,

implanted, severity of hearing loss and how they can help cochlear
implant candidates. Then, candidates can choose to "start a
conversation" with the mentor directly from their profile.
