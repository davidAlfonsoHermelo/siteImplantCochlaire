A lot of folks have posted their journey in getting Cochlear implants.
Mine has just begun. I`m still not sure what I will decide to do or
even if I will qualify. Everything I have read on it makes me feel like
I fit the criteria. Today I am getting my MRI and I was told they will
be giving me more test. I have no idea what kind of test other than the
typical hearing tones and words. If anyone knows what else they may do
let me know. I have a follow up appointment Friday with the ENT so I`m
guessing I won`t get very much information today.

Put the effort in learning sign. You'l be better for it.
But if your hearts set in the drill, fair enough,
Are aids no longer working for you?

Meaning you've totally maxed out on that ear? No response whatsoever,
or very low response? I would opt for a CI then. As I've said
progressive loss folks do very well with a CI.

I was nervous and here I am today.
My lip reading is going to crap now, and still learning ASL as Im
completely Deaf without my CI's.
But I love the silence from time to time.... its a lot to get used to
but it all falls into place.
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

There is still the risk of significant side effects from the surgery.
Might want to investigate those more too. My second implant messed up
my balance in that I can't do a forward flip or roll or hang my head
upside down without getting severe
Nausea/ motion sickness for several hours. I used to love going on
roller coasters too. Also he didn't think there was much chance of it
improving if implant was removed. Surgeon had no idea of the cause
either. Also changed my taste sensation as well.

My hearing aids were maxed out in both ears. But in my left I still can
hear a bit with them and understand. In my right ear I hear very little
if anything and have absolutely no comprehension. They are wanting to
do it in the right ear. I`m thinking I will do it. I pretty much have
nothing to lose. I do still want to learn ASL. I`ve been out of work
for over a month now and realize my job is not what`s best for me.
Don`t get me wrong I`m not going to up and quit. But now I would like
to learn ASL and maybe get a degree and teach. My wife is a teacher and
be around more people so if anyone is out there feeling they are the
only one like I did growing up I can help. This forum has been so
helpful the past week. When I grew up we didn`t have the internet or
cell phones so it wasn`t as easy to reach out.

Sounds like you're on the right track! And OMG that would be AMAZING if
you became an ASL fluent TOD!!!!! Georgia is SO bad with inclusive
education of dhh kids....I know someone (HOH and oral) who is the
product of Georgia schools who still has issues with the difference
between boycotted and boycotting!

My fiancé was born profoundly Deaf and got a CI when he was 15. He can
hear some things with the CI but cannot process speech. He uses sign
and lipreads very well. He is very happy with his decision. The only
problem he has with the CI is vertigo when he is laying down with his
head in an odd position. Other than that, it has been great! He has one
foot in the hearing world and one foot in the Deaf world. I hope it
goes well for you.

Thank you guys. I'm meeting with my job this morning to see what they
want to do with me. I think I'm more nervous about that. I feel like
they will move me to a different department. If so that's fine but it
will be like starting over and I hope I like where they move me if they
do. I work in an auto plant and I drive around and supply the assembly
line. With my hearing shot I don't think they will want me to drive all
over the place in all that traffic

Bing Deaf doesnt affect your ability to drive.
Dont accept that nonsense from them...

Show them studies that prove Deaf people are better drivers than
hearing people. Hearing people get distracted by sounds (radio,
constructions, other noises), while Deaf people have better peripheral
vision and noise does not distract them.

HA! I`m sorry You all misunderstood what I do. I drive what is called a
P.I.V. A Powered Industrial Vehicle. Where I`m at is a lot of
pedestrian traffic. ALOT! and also other PIVs We use our horns to
communicate with one another. I have driven out into busy aisles before
in front of people because I didn't hear the horns. But now that I've
lost all hearing in the left ear I`m facing the facts that maybe I need
to move somewhere else. I talked to the company doctor today and he was
very understanding. He said I have been successful in my job for the
past 5 years but with what is going on maybe we need to move to another
department at least temporarily. He hopes after my surgery I will
recover and hear better than I do now. So right now I need to schedule
the surgery, find out how long until I can come back, and then see if I
need to move out of my current department. It could be a good thing.
Maybe I will land somewhere better.

In all likelihood, you are going to have much better hearing than you
have had following activation and rehab. Approaching surgery/recovery
as a temporary disability with job reassignment would be ideal. It's
difficult to predict how fast one will recover. I had hearing
immediately, but it is always overwhelming for everyone because you are
no longer limited to a small hearing window. That means you'll be
re-learning to hear with much more information. I worked in an office
at the time, so my daily environment was "quiet." Keep in mind that
during those days, just going in the breakroom/kitchen would be
overwhelming with the hum of the vending machines, refrigerators, and
microwave ovens. Your work environment will definitely be overwhelming.
Today, I work in a similar environment and do depend on my hearing for
afety and communication.
You should be hoping and expecting to hear better in the end. That is
generally what happens, particularly for people who are very auditory-
inclined to begin with. This is a very exciting time in your life!

Thank you. I am excited. And as of right now my job has been very
upportive

Ok. I went to the doctor today and he said everything on his end looked
good enough to go ahead with the surgery. My CT scan showed some
concern with my sinuses so I am seeing a different doctor about that
Monday. I'm guessing maybe that is why I have had that fluid blocking
my ear off and on for the past few years. I have been battleing a sinus
infection for the past month but never really had any issues before.
I`m not too concerned about it. If the sinus doctor thinks I need
urgery with that we will still do the CI first so I can get my lazy
butt back to work as soon as possible. Right now we are waiting for
them to contact the insurance company and by Wednesday we should maybe
have a date. It will be an out patient surgery and last about 2-3
hours. They will make a small cut in my head and implant an internal
device. I will be completely deaf until 4-5 weeks after. Then I will be
given an external device that will be activated. After that its just a
process of learning and recognizing sounds again
