I have noticed them already, thanks.
I would like to see some feedback from an ordinary 'joe the builder'
type and not someone on a website from the manufacturer, if you get my
drift...
I mean they are hardly going to say anything bad about their product
are they.

they are still doing trails and finding ways to improve speech
discrimination with the implantable hearing aid. The microphone that is
implanted under the skin has to be more sensitive while blocking out
the body sounds that the mic may pick up. I heard some have good
results from it and some that had to much hearing loss for it to work.

Carina is for moderate hearing loss. There probably are not many here
who would qualify.

toffee pie,
I have not heard of Carina, but I agree that it's important to talk to
other people about it. I just don't know where to find more people who
use Carina.
Here's another implantable hearing device that you could check out.
It's a Vibrant Soundbridge. You'll have to wear an external headpiece.
Check it out: VIBRANT MED-EL
It's for sensoreneural hearing loss. It's for those with
modereate-to-severe hearing loss, too. It's implantable in the middle
ear.
Have you heard about BAHA hearing device?

Just an observation.
It's amazing how deaf people get mixed reactions from considering
cochlear implants, but when it comes to implantable hearing devices or
devices for people with moderate-to-severe hearing loss, people are
helpful without saying a negative thing.

I have just had a carina implant operation in Hamburg tuesday 22nd of
eptember 2009. At the moment I still have bandaid around my head and I
cannot hear much on the ear. I was told at the hospital it is quite
normal as it takes around 2 weeks for blood and liquid to leave the
middle ear. I will let you know how it is going.

This device is investigational in the USA and you cannot get one in the
USA until the company would gain approval (FDA approval of any device
is not guaranteed and the results of any trial is typically not
announced until an FDA decision is made).
If FDA approval is given, you will be able to determine the efficacy of
the device and make a more informed decision.

Carina Otologic operation
I had an otologic operation in Hamburg 22nd of september 2009.
5 month before this date I had a meeting with Professor Verse from
Hospital in Hamburg and Thomas Witt from Otologics. I asked questions
and they told me about the operation and the implant. I went home to
figure out whether this was something for me or not. I took contact to
Veronika Koch who has the carina.
I decided to go ahead and went to germany sept. 21st 2009 where I had a
CT scanning made of my head.
Operation day.
Sept. 22nd I went to the hospital 7 in the morning and was operated
from app. 9-12. 1 oclock pm I woke up from the narcosis. I was totally
deaf on the operated ear because og blood and liquid after operation. 3
oclock I went back to my hotel with a huge badage around my head and a
drain (bottle where the blood could run into) was attached to the back
of my head. I did not have any pain. My nose kept running - felt like I
had a cold. I was told it is because the ear are producing liquid which
runs out of a tube in the ear. I
only slept for a few hours - then I sat up reading - cause I felt the
best sitting up. I will not call it pain - but an unconfortable
feeling.
Day 2
Next morning at 10 I went back to hospital for check up. When they cut
off the bandage (which is very tight) I felt so sick I had to lie down.
They gave me a drop and 10 minutes later I was fine again. They changed
the bandage and I should come back in the evening. In the evening they
gave me a drop for pain. The night was exactly the same as the first
night.
Day 3
I went to hospital 10 in the morning. They took out the drain from the
back of my head and changed the bandage. The took a bone leading
hearing test - which showed I could have lost a little of my usual
hearing. Then we drove back to Denmark.
2 week after operation
The swelling of the head has gone - and I feel like I have black and
blue marks in the head. The skin and scalp has to get used to the
implant. Still can´t hear anything.
My own doctor have removed the stiches - and the shaved hairs has
tarted to grow out. (You cannot see the shaving as it is under the
upper hair. My hair was so filtered after the operation I had to cut
ome of it of.
4 weeks after operation
I still feel now and then that I have a blue mark. My hearing has
improved, but not back to what it was before operation and it is still
clicking in the ear and my own voice still sounds like I am in a
tunnel. I have no problems sleeping. There is only 1 place where I can
feel i have something under my skin - between over my ear and temple I
can feel an edge. I will write further in 4 weeks.

Here 8 weeks after operation I had the Carina activated yesterday. It
took around 2 hours - this is the first fitting of many. I hear my own
ounds - like when I swallow, my hair going back and forth over the
microfone, when I eat (carrots for example) it sounds very loud. My
brain has to get used to all these sounds.
The volume will be slowly raised át each fitting till maximum -
hereafter I can ajust the volume down with the remote control.
In january I will tell you how my first month with the activation has
been, and I am travelling by plane in december - I will inform you what
is happening in the security control!!
Old 11-21-2009, 01:56 AM   #20
Let us know if you have to turn the device off during the flight or if
the function changes during the flight. That would be very interesting
to know.
I don't think security should be an issue. As with most implants, I
would think that you have an identification card showing you have the
implant?

Is it suppose to be better than a CI?

It is different than a CI. You don´t destroy your usual hearing. My
usual hearing goes from 20-30 down to 50-60 and up again to 20-30. This
means that if they find a way to cure hearing loss with stemmcells - it
is still possible. Professor Stefan Heller is telling about it on
youtube.
Old 12-11-2009, 10:46 AM   #23
How is the Carina working for you? What level of functional gain are
you getting (500Hz and 1000Hz, and 2000Hz).
Can you describe how it sounds?

From reading the above=Carina hearing aid-is not a Cochlear Implant.
Thus can't be compared at all.
Oddly enough the first time I ever heard of Carina is right here-now.
How it compares to other Hearing Aids- cost wise?

of the device would only come down if it becomes popular, but it is
hard for something to become popular when it's very expensive.
Harder, can I ask why you decided to get this done? I mean was it
because you don't like the look of hearing aids, you like to do sport
in water, you wanted a better result? Thanks.

I think i would stick with Cochlear. and Besides, if somebody who is
deaf and suddenly decides to get Carina, how will one believe that they
are deaf? i mean it doesn't really make sense to me, because being deaf
is an important part of me so, no, i wouldn't do it.

I think the fact they're not used for pediatric purpose may have
omething to do with it.
But please correct me if I'm wrong.

Oh and there was some weird tubeless implant thing awhile back that hit
the news....seems to have shrunk without a trace. Most of the hype
about the new technology is news release driven.
