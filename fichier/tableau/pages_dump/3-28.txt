ClearVoice
It's amazing how ClearVoice could make conversation a lot easier for
you. I have had it for over a year now. And even now....thinking about
it I realised how much it really does help. I was driving and not
realising this untill now that I am able to hear the passenger voice a
lot more than I used to. ClearVoice cuts out the sound of the car
engine, winds and traffic near by. As soon as the background noise
appear clear voice automatically kicks in. High Five to Advanced
Bionics for bring ClearVoice out!

3 years later!
Can you believe it 3 years ago I went under the knife to get this
amazing cochlear implant. I was so nervous and I almost changed my
mind. I am so glad I went ahead with it. There nothing to be afraid of
when having a surgery - its a bit like getting a headache the next day
which doesn't last long. I can't believe how quick has it gone. I'm
loving this hearing journey - its the best thing you could ever ask
for. With my hearing aid I couldn't hear anything apart from loud noise
and I have to lip-read all the time. With the Advanced Bionics I have
now has help me to hear all sort of everyday environment sounds and I
can actually hear people talking too. I don't always hear every word
but I must say I don't lip-read as much as I used to lip-read and I can
now hear on the phone. Only to the people I know well. I am still
learning and there is more to learn. I never used to be into music and
I now can't go on a long journey trip without my I-pod. I've made loads
of friends especially world wide after creating this blog and I have
met up with a lot of people who are now waiting to get an implant or
has just had them. There journey seems to be going so well just like
mine! Here to the next 3 years :-)
