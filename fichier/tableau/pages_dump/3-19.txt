She's in BIG trouble!!!
__________________________________________________________________
Well, after having an implant for about 5 months now, my daughter has
milked this enough. The Audie said she has only been wearing it for
about an hour a day, which is not enough to get it to work properly. I
kept wondering why she hasn't been improving like she should be
expected to. Well, she's been taking it off in school, because she
doesn't want to feel different, and when she gets home, she wears it,
but has it turned off to make it look like she has had it on, but
didn't. Then, she takes it off for the rest of the night saying that
he is tired, and having it on all day in school is fatiguing, which of
course now I know she hasn't even been wearing it.
Well, I warned her.
Unfortunately, now she has lost all internet privileges for the next 6
weeks until the next office visit. No cell phone, no computer for
internet to play games on. If she doesn't have enough hours of use
logged when we go back, the phone stays confiscated.
I hate doing these things, but I am forced to. She basically, lied to
all of use for months. So, there will be consequences to her actions.
If she has to learn the hard way, so be it. Besides, she's addicted to
texting on that stupid cell phone, and playing internet games anyway.
Teenagers!
Funny thing is, now that she has been forced to wear it in school, a
couple kids have asked what it is, and how it works. Their only
response, "Oh, that is so cool". She's kind of a shy girl, but now
he's getting more friendly attention than ever, when she thought she
would be picked on. What she doesn't realize, is that modern day kids
love all that hi-tech gizmo stuff. It's not quite like the old days.
LOL

It seems like it must be more than just wanting to fit in, if she turns
it off and takes it off at home as well.
A fifteen year old should have some say over what happens to their own
body.

Why are you forcing your child to feel difference , it's hard enough
being teenager today and not allowing her to talk to her friends is
down right cruel ! I think this is the most horrible thing you can do
your teenage daughter force her to feel difference . Have you even
tried putting
yourself in your daughter's place for even one minute ?? This is one of
most upsetting thread I see here . I really horrible for your child ,
you're too blind to see what you're doing to her !

I can totally understand! I was forced into being mainstreamed with all
hearing peers and forced to wear a FM system. I purposely found ways to
not wear it by not charging it, breaking the mic and etc...finally the
chool gave up after months of fighting with me to wear it. Who wants
to feel different when they aren't ready to accept it. Don't punish her
pls. She is having an identity crisis and is in a very vulnerable state
of mind. Believe me I was there 30 years ago and it was HELL!!!

Is there something else involved?
When she disconnects her Cochlear Implant presumably she hears nothing
How exactly does that square with "fitting in" with her hearing
friends? Does she use ASL?
Do all her friends know and use ASL as well?
Was she not advised in order for her brain to "process sound from her
Implant" she must have it on all the time for her brain to get used to
new sound?
Was she "excited" about getting a Cochlear implant thus hoping if
uitable-of hearing much more speech- then she heard in the past?
Even odder-most females can "cover their Implants" while most males
can't-it is very obvious.
Whether 15 is "adulthood" is your area thus has/had some "say" on the
operation- I can't say.
I suspect there is a lot more to this situation which can't exactly
"spelled out" in this forum. On the face of it perhaps extended
discussion with the "appropriate health person" psychologist etc-may
give insight on the immediate situation.
Much luck in a resolution in the near future which brings some peace.

First off, she desperately wants to hear, but she is not motivated to
do what is necessary to make that happen. She is an incredible student
in school, and wants to be a doctor when she grows up. She has the
grades to do it too. I even talked about this with both doctors, and
they agree. She wore it last year in middle school, but now she's in
High School, and she had this weird idea in her head that people
actually care about it, like she's a freak or something, which of
course she isn't, and absolutely no one gives her a hard time about it.
If anything, all the kids think it's pretty cool.
And no, I didn't push her for months. I gave her so much leeway, she
has wasted everything to this point. Now is the time to step in and
correct the problem. It's called parenting.
And yes, she is learning ASL, but only because she likes it as a back
up, not because she wants to use it as her primary means of
communicating.
At 15yo, I do have the authority to make decisions about her life.
That's called parenting. It boggles my mind when people think a child
is actually truly capable of making these kinds of decisions. Should
they have a part? Of course, but the ultimate decision is mine. When
he is a legal adult living on her own, then she has every right to
live her life as she chooses. If people on here don't like it, that's
too dang bad!!! Grow up. You can take your liberal Dr. Spock garbage
and toss it in the trash. I love my children, and care for them a lot
more than anyone on here, so don't patronize me with all this garbage
about her making these kinds of decisions, because she is still a
child, whether you think so or not.
Have your own children and find out what happens when you, the doctors,
nurses, school district, and everyone associated spent months fighting
to get this for her when she begged for it, and you have over $100,000
pent on insurance to make it happen.
Especially when she begged and pleaded for it, because she wants to go
to the same school.
She was fully aware of the commitment involved when this process
tarted. There is no going back.
When you make a commitment to something, you stick to it, even if you
have to tough it out a bit. One does not truly excel in life by simply
walking away from a problem every time you don't "feel" good for a
little while. This is what's wrong with our society today. No
conviction, No discipline, and a complete breakdown of real parenting.
I fully understand her feelings, because I was a bullied skinny little
kid in school. But, I didn't become a nuclear engineer by complaining
about other kids picking on me, or having stay up every night to study,
because I was tired, or didn't feel good. I did it anyway, because I
needed to, in order to succeed. If I made every decision in my life
based on simply how I felt when I pouted, I'd be living in a dumpster
on welfare.
I'm not here to be her best friend. I'm here to be her parent.
btw, she didn't like the FM system either, because it bothered her. She
did well in school anyway without it. Now she is almost completely
deaf, and she begged to get this CI so she can stay in school without
any other means needed to accommodate her. Well, if that's what she
wants (and it still is, btw), she needs to have the discipline to get
it. As her father, I will make sure she gets what she wants. It's all
about the end game, not about how you feel at the moment.
Is she ticked off at me? Well, yeah. I would be too when I was 15. So
what? After a good long talk, she understands she brought on her
banishment from the internet by her own laziness, not mine. BTW, she is
ADDICTED to the internet, and she is already understanding she needs to
do this. She has been horribly unfocused for months, but just a good
prodding is finally getting her head back on straight. In fact when I
told her I fully understand, because she is pig headed and stubborn....
like me... she laughed, because she knows she is her fathers daughter.

Bottesini,
No, I do not hate you.
I'm not saying treat your kids badly, because that IS abuse. There is a
big difference between discipline, and abuse. Discipline is invoked to
provide focus, and proper behavior. But everyone's personality is
different. Unconditional love, with no sense of consequences doesn't
work in my family. Never has, never will. In fact, with most people it
doesn't either. It can be a delicate balance when parenting. You have
to know when to give them room, and when to put your foot down.
I didn't make it through boot camp with my Company Commander giving me
unconditional love. LOL

. . .
Please remember, the relationship between your CC and you, and your
daughter and you, are not the same thing. Your CC didn't love you, and
you didn't love him, conditional or unconditional.
You should love your child, the only condition being the
father-daughter relationship. That doesn't mean her behaviors won't
have consequences. It means that despite the behavior and consequences
the love will still be there. Withholding love should never be one of
those consequences.
I'm a retired Vietnam-era Navy veteran (as is my husband), so I know
about CC's and boot camp. I'm also a mother and grandmother, so I know
about parent-child relationships, too. Believe me, they are not the
ame, nor they should be.
I'm a baby boomer, so I know about Dr. Spock but neither my parents nor
I used him for our parental guidelines.

Can she talk to other kids in same position
Old 10-09-2015, 11:57 AM   #21
do what is necessary to make that happen. . . She wore it last year in
middle school, but now she's in High School, and she had this weird
idea in her head that people actually care about it, like she's a freak
or something, which of course she isn't, and absolutely no one gives
her a hard time about it. If anything, all the kids think it's pretty
cool.
Her motivation to hear may be strong but at this age the motivation to
be one of the crowd may be even stronger. Sometimes what was acceptable
during middle school years is all of a sudden totally unacceptable in
high school. For some people, being noticed as "different" can be
painful, even if it's a positive difference. A teen doesn't necessarily
want to stand out, even for the best of reasons. The good news is, this
is usually temporary, after some maturity takes place and "fitting in"
gets put into perspective. At that time, her priorities should change.
they have a part? Of course, but the ultimate decision is mine.
Of course you have the right to make the final decisions but the
child's feelings should be taken into consideration, whenever possible.
When she is a legal adult living on her own, then she has every right
to live her life as she chooses. If people on here don't like it,
that's too dang bad!!! Grow up. You can take your liberal Dr. Spock
garbage and toss it in the trash. I love my children, and care for them
a lot more than anyone on here, so don't patronize me with all this
garbage about her making these kinds of decisions, because she is still
a child, whether you think so or not.
You and I are life-long hearing people. No matter how much we might
empathize with deaf and hoh people, we can't really feel what they
feel. That's especially the case with those who were marginalized from
infancy on just because their hearing and speech was "different." They
pent their formative years standing out (and not in a good way). They
have life experiences that influence their perspective and insight that
they're trying to share with you. It has nothing to do with liberality
or Dr. Spock. Their childhoods may not mirror your daughter's but you
hould still give respectful attention to what they offer.
That's probably how my dad felt when he punished me for not wearing the
hideous orthodontic neck device in public. I strongly wanted braces and
traight teeth but I just as strongly didn't want to wear the awful and
highly visible neck strap in public. So, I wore it at home only. That
wasn't good enough for my dad, who thought I was blowing the whole
treatment process. I had just turned 16, was in a new high school in a
new state, and definitely not a popular kid (very introvert). So this
was all I needed to look even dorkier. I could take punishment better
than having my peers look at me weirdly. So, for the rest of the school
year (several months) I couldn't watch TV at all (this was 1967), and
when the family went on their weekly pizza outing I had to stay home
alone. I know that it pained my dad to do this but he didn't know what
else to do. (He was an electrical engineer working in aeronautics,
private and government, and NASA--to him, my behavior wasn't logical.)
Obviously, I'm not comparing to a few years of inconvenience to a life
long "difference" but only showing some similar family dynamics.
I don't think she wants to go back. I think she's going thru a life
phase where her social position is taking a higher than usual priority.
Sadly, at this age, it's common to think the world revolves around self
and how everyone else is viewing self.
I don't think she's walking away from her commitment; more like a
detour but she can eventually get back on track.
She isn't you, and you aren't her.
Have you told her about your childhood obstacles and how you overcame
them? Did you tell it in a way that was positive and not in a way that
made her feel lesser for not being you?
Of course. But you are a parent, not a Company Commander.
did well in school anyway without it.
What's that tell you? Despite these bumps in the road, she CAN succeed,
and she's proven it. Try to see the positive.
Now she is almost completely deaf, and she begged to get this CI so she
can stay in school without any other means needed to accommodate her.
Well, if that's what she wants (and it still is, btw), she needs to
have the discipline to get it. As her father, I will make sure she gets
what she wants. It's all about the end game, not about how you feel at
the moment.
Yes but it takes time. She's intelligent so she'll realize sooner or
later what she needs to do, and adjust her behavior accordingly.
Keep up the good long talks. I'm afraid digital addiction is seriously
a problem for a whole generation.
