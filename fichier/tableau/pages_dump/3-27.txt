I don't think HOH=ME ever claimed to be anything other than someone
that had hearing, lost it, and then was implanted. He then goes on to
ay that he is grateful for the ability to hear again and recommends it
to others including babies.

chools, and all kinds of other things for their children. Other people
making legal choices for their babies isn't any of my business and

This forum is "Alldeaf" so you are going to have to recognize that all

I believe this forum was created mainly for those who were born deaf
(medically) and are immersed in Deaf culture now, either from birth or
later (if they were raised orally).
The fact that they tolerate those of us who are deaf/HoH and have not
chosen to learn ASL and immerse ourselves in Deaf culture is
appreciated by myself. I know I have probably made audist statements in
the few years I've been here and I apologize for that.
Just as it is hard for me to imagine what it is like to grow up deaf,
I'm sure it is hard for those who were born deaf or lost their hearing
at a young age to imagine what it is like to hear.

You are wrong. I am deaf, but my deafness has been fixed with CI's.
Just curious--for those that think HA's and CI's are evil, do you wear
glasses or would you wear them if your sight required it????
No, this forum is Hearing Aids and Cochlear Implants .

One mother in a parent of deaf and hoh children FB group claim that it
is because of her son's 2nd implant, he is in advanced math.
Ok if people are implanting babies which is their business BUT that
view that this mother holds will be rampant in which will leave those
deaf who don't have implants with a stigma as if they aren't as smart,
functioning, or as valued as those who have implants.
These audist views that does nobody any good and I see examples of
those views here in this thread. Seriously?

The part I don't get is why someone with hearing loss that functions in
a totally hearing world and does not sign, is not on The AG Bell, or CI
focused forums/communities. To come here and preach audism seems a bit
like trolling?

Isn't the name of this forum "ALLDEAF.Com"?
Thus "presumably" the DEAF who use a Cochlear Implant can be part and
not be considered- "trolling?

This forum is allDeaf, the subforum is hearing aids and ci.
Comparing glasses to.ci doesnt hold, as it ignores culture and

normalization and assimilation on our future.

minoority..
Nope. They only become this so-called "cultural or linguistic minority"
by deprivation of both a sense and their natural culture. Their natural
culture is the one they are born into within their family.
A tiny group of Deafies salivating over an infant born into the world
with a broken sense, hungry to grab them from their families and
natural culture to make them like them is creepy. Their lack of or
limitation in that sense doesn't automatically make them one of yours
anymore than an adult going deaf does. There are ways to prevent their
being sucked into a culture that depends on inability to interact with
the world at large, just like becoming religious can be staved off by
education.
I'm for full access for children born or going deaf. They can decide as
they get older if they want to be part of or even like your world.
They'll have that choice versus just defaulting because they have no
choice.
This is a great thread! Any parent with half a brain reading it is
going to do everything they can for their child to access world at
large versus handing them over to deaf adherents that use cultish
"logic."
It really is bizarre that a "late-deafened" individual shows no signs
of ever having actually been that and is one of those being loudest
about "culture"... a culture you were never born into and is not really
yours... which explains the loud protesting whereas one who actually
was born into it would be more likely to have a live and let live
approach.

Its not so called. We ARE a culture, sign IS a language, and we ARE a
minority...areyou arguing we Deaf are the majority??
natural culture to make them like them is creepy. h.
We are actually not a tiny group...you seem to be an expert on us...let
me ask you something, to help gauge your expertise here
Do you sign?

Our culture doesnt depend on inability, your adudism betrays you..our
culture rests on ability. Sign is an ability...not a lacking
choice. h.
So you say, excuse me if i feel your full of it..
"logic."h.
It truly is, i havnt seen audism like this come out the sewers for a
while...your bigotry is shinning
Its not that bizzare at all. Your post just betrays your utter lack of
knowlege of us our history and how we accept people.
I was hearie for 9 years of my life...ive been Deaf a signer for 30...
Our history is full of people that went Deaf just like me at my age who
were Deaf and accepted as Deaf,even in leadership positions,
torytellers, poets, bizzare....? its not. rare it is not!..You havnt
the faintest clue what your on about.
I wont school you here to much, because i know your not sencere...
But give a read of our history, and you will find many many kids that
went Deaf, as Deaf. And accepted as such...a famous example would be
veditz, of the preservation of sign language fame...we accept you, and
our culture becomes yours when you sign and are one of us...or when
your born one of us, when sign is denied you...we feel its your
birthright language...
Yeah you sit there an authoritaran wagging a finger at me about a
culture your posts clearly show you know little about..and you expect
to be taken seriously.....
Spare me..
Live and let live? Pls by all means leave our babies and kids the hell
alone...take your fetish drils and messiah tech and shove it where i
igns dont shine....

But, Deaf babies aren't yours. We can just educate those parents about
our subculture. But, if they don't want ASL, then there is nothing that
we can do.
It's little weird to claim Deaf babies are your children.

Curious... childern as a whole are generally consider "ours" in one way
or another... we as a society are or often feel responsible for
childern... maybe its the whole "it takes a village" adage... but it
does stand to reason that one would feel that a child is part of his or
her society or identity if they are born or obtain a classifying
freature of it .... hmm really does not surprise me woth how much
better African Americans fair compared to other minorities....

Im not the first to use this language in regards to sign being a
birthright for our culture and people...its stretches back a fair ways
actually...you can even find it in nad literature. And british Deaf
literature too.
Its not ncommon.or rare for minority groups to actually use possesive
terms such as this.."our people", "our children", "our language", "our
culture"...ive never used nor will i ever use mine,or my..( in regards
to babies or children) for obvious reasons...but i have used and do use
my people in reference to Deaf, and my language and our language in
reference to sign
Even the secular state uses terms such as this as well in a number of
ways..
Its not that rare..

Some years ago, my parents and I were having a conversation, in which
the topic of bagels came up. I don't recall how we got to it and or the
immediate preceding sentence to the following but what I remember <and
how this post relates to hoich's above> is that my mom said "they
aren't ours anymore, Moishe".
Moishe is my dad's Jewish name.
That is the bagels aren't "ours" - as in the cultural, ethnic
definition.
Most people in the U.S. now know what bagels are and you don't have to
go to Chicago or N.Y. to get them
But it's an example - one of many that has taken place in my experience
- of "peoplehood"
like Deaf are a cultural group...Deaf being the people of the eye in
most instances

Inability to interact with hearing people? You just demoralized a group
of people who have been able to purchase cars, homes, go out in the
community, and raise hearing kids with success. You have a audist view.

Meh, that wasn't an "article". It was an opinion piece, more like a
blog. It was full of bias and unsubstantiated opinion. No evidence, no
research, just anecdotes, we know this guy, there's a couple of cases.
Poo on that.
I saw someone wondering about people who implanted early. I have an
ancedotal case for that. I'm a massage therapist, when I was going to
chool for it my loss was severe in one ear, profound in the other. I
did not use an aid in my profound ear, only my severe one. There was a
guy in my class that was Deaf and had a CI. At the time (2007) he was
maybe 24-26. So now he'd be about 33-35. Anyway, he used an
interpreter, but he communicated with us well. Not sure exactly how old
he was but he didn't really have a typical deaf accent, he had one, but
not the recognizable deaf accent you usually hear so I think he got it
fairly young, elementary age maybe. Later on we ended up working at the
ame place, at this point I had lost more hearing and was relying more
heavily on lip reading. He would see/hear me trying to have a
conversation with coworkers and he would tell me everyday, EVERY DAY,
that I needed to get a CI.
He loved his and highly recommended.

As all bussiness exist again obviously to make a profit, im sure the

We Deaf dont see the drive, push and manipulation towards assimiliation
in our best interests, we have always resisted and opposed it, seeing
it exactly for what it is..."oralisms final solution"....we do not see
it at all in the best interests for our babies implanted against there
will..it certainly IS very much in the interests and profit of the ci
corps, not us..
My interests is with my people, our future, wich is our babies and our
young, not in feeding conpanies profit margins..my interest is in the
preservation and advancment of my culture and our language..that are
constantly attacked and threatened by ci and rhe professionals peddling

Indeed we wont agree in this issue CI....all cool..well i thought the
article was balanced....but i know to others it msy seem a bit
extreme...its certainly not more.extreme then the push to implant...if
anything the stand not to early implant is a more moderate stand then
the rush to implant.
Good to see....

Not surprising but we don't seem to agree about what "balanced" means

In the context of an article I think of a "balanced" one as giving
information about both sides of an issue.
