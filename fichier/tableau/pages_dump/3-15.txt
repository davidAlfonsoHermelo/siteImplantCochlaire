THE PROFESSIONAL VIEW
This department was originally titled “The Audist View.” “Audist”
refers to those who maintain the supremacy of speech, speechreading,
and ultilizing residual hearing as a deaf person’s primary mode of
communication. This includes deaf and hearing oralists, professionals
in the medical/audiological field who work with deaf patiemts and
clients, cochlear-implant advocates, surgeons, speech therapists,
clinicians, and parents. However, as Ryan McCreery’s response shows,
it’s not necessarily a black-and-white, good guys-and-bad-guys
cenario. A number of audiologists and other clinicians and medical
professionals respect the Deaf community and recognize the diversity of
communication choices for their deaf clients. Some already know sign
language, and some are learning it, so that they can better communicate
with their clients and patients. This is a good trend.
Not all audiologists are audists, and it is therefore unfair to
tereotype them as adhering to a repressive oralism-or-nothing
philosophy.

The importance of establishing bridges between Audiology and Deaf
Culture: an audiologist’s view
To Whom It May Concern:
I have been monitoring the Cochlear War website for some time, as I am
interested in learning more about the views of the Deaf Culture and
Community regarding cochlear implantation. As a Pediatric Audiologist,
I work with a vareity of families to help them learn about hearing
loss, but primarily to help them and their children to learn to
communicate. I realize that many in the Deaf Culture and Community have
had extremely negative experiences with Audiologists, and that there
are many Audiologists who do not respect the heritage and language of
the Deaf Culture. However, I am concerned that your website seems to
make no distinction between those Audioloigists and a growing number of
us who encourage families to learn ASL, seek mentors and information
from the Deaf Community, and do not believe that hearing aids, cochlear
implants or any other form of Audiological Habilitation are a “cure”
for hearing loss.
Instead, your website promotes the idea that all Audiologists are
“Audists.” I understand that a large number of Audiologists would
probably qualify as Audists, but I think it's important for families to
realize that there are a number of us who are not opposed to the Deaf
Culture, and recognize the Deaf Community as an invaluable resource for
our families. While I value the opinions and experiences of Deaf
Individuals, the information presented on your website makes the Deaf
Culture seem inflexible, uncooperative, and unfriendly, which I know is
not true, because I have friends and associates who are Deaf.
I think it’s important to consider your target audience. Over 90% of
children with hearing loss are born to hearing parents, most of whom
have little or no information about the Deaf Culture. Thanks in part to
universal newborn hearing screening in many states, the first
professional a family meets when they have a child with hearing loss is
an Audiologist. A good Audiologist is your greatest ally in educating
families about the Deaf Culture and the language and history associated
with it. If I didn't know the Deaf Culture from my own personal
experiences and I came across the information on your website, I would
be less likely to consider sharing this point of view with families,
imply because the way the information is presented makes the Deaf
Culture seem scary to hearing people.
I know from my experience that putting hearing families with deaf
childrenin contact with the Deaf Community is incredibly important for
the parents and their children. I agree with your statement that the
views and opinions of the Deaf Culture on many issues are unfairly
ignored as part of the big picture. However, instead of sharing all the
wonderful history, language and benefits associated with being part fo
the Deaf Culture, your website stereotypes Audiologists as Audists, and
in the process gives parents the idea that we’re opposed to each other
in some way, when really, it’s not like that. I feel like more energy
hould be put towards building cooperation between Audiology and the
Deaf Culture, since I think that both are important parts of helping
families. The Cochlear War Website seeks to divide rather than build
this cooperation, and it puts me in an incredibly frustrating position.
