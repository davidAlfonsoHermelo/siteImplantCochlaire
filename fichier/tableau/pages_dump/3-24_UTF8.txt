I found a rare article.
Don't ask me how I found it. (I had to make phone calls in order to
find this stuff)
Sweet sound published by the House Research Institute
"One of the principal advantages of implantable hearing aids is that
they directly transfer the amplified signal into vibrational energy,
which drives the ear," says Jonathan Spindel, a biomedical engineer at
James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. "You've taken out the
tep that degrades the signal." Avoiding Feedback
That's in theory. Actually getting there has been a challenge. Since
the microphone is under the skin, the device must be specially adjusted
to cancel out all the sounds of the body itself. Otologics, for
example, found that the sound of skin rubbing over the microphone can
cause feedback every time a patient moves his or her head, and the
patient's voice reverberating through the skull cavity is also picked
up.
Tweaking the adjustments on the device appears to minimize these
problems. In a first clinical trial of patients published last year in
the journal Otolaryngology, patients who received the Otologics Carina
implant in only one ear performed slightly worse on hearing tests than
with the conventional hearing aids they had used before the surgery.
But in the company's second, still unpublished clinical trial before
which tweaks were made patients heard more clearly than people in the
first trial as well as those with conventional hearing aids. Of the 10
people tested, two had to have the device removed because of a
technical glitch that has since been corrected, says ear surgeon Drew
Horlbeck, who headed the trial at Wilford Hall Medical Center in San
Antonio. Of the other eight, most say the implant is "as good as a
hearing aid, and a few of them feel it's better," says Dr. Horlbeck,
who is currently working in Jacksonville, Fla."
According to the published article, the Carina's Implantable microphone
is 100 percent effective (better than conventional hearing aids) in the
econd trial. This is very important because the Cochlear Ltd. is
borrowing Otologic's exact Implantable microphone for the Totally
Implantable C.I.
So, believe it or not, the Totally Implantable Cochlear Implant's
microphone is already 100 percent perfect (just like the Carina's mic
in the second clinical trial).
This should answer a lot of questions in this forum.
Also, there is one thing that has been driving me crazy!! The Carina
and Envoy were about on the same pace in clinical trials. The Envoy got
FDA-approved in 2010. The Carina was anticipated to get approved in
2010, too. But, for some reason, all the way up to 2012 it's still not
approved in the USA. What is going on with that? The Carina has been
commercially available (CE mark) in Europe since 2006. Come on! Get
approved in the US already. Then they can get the Totally Implantable
Cochlear Implant rolling.

Cochlear said this...
Cochlear, he says, is moving towards trials, with key hurdles, such as
a battery that is recharged through the skin and a problematic
implanted microphone, already overcome.
Cochlear is the owner of Otologics. The french cochlear implant company
Neurelec and Otologics got in lawsuit problems. Cochlear is the winner!

Hello Forum.
I am VERY glad I found you.
I am considering having a Carina device implanted. I am trying to
collect as much information as I can before making such a big step. Are
there any more recent news about it?
I have been using external hearing aid device for decades. Now I am
imply tired, would like to make my life just simpler. I suffer from
moderate hearing loss, both ears (going to worsen in old age).
It seems IMPOSSIBLE to speak to someone who actually had this kind of
urgery and is actually using the device.
So I should be soooo grateful if someone could give me a precious
feedback about their experience. (Including Harder65! Please!)
Thanks so much. Congrats on the Forum.

Given the cost factor- surgery etc. how does one know that there will
no further increase in their hearing loss? What then? Another
operation?
As I commented #25, Jan 11/12 not much consideration for more trials.

Implantable CI reminded me of that dude from years ago who was
completely and totally fixtated on it.

So why not enjoy a few years respite compared to always wearing - or
not *always* wearing - an external hearing aid?
Is there anyone with an actual experience with the Carina device that
would like to share it in this forum? That would help so much.
(FYI, other kinds of CIs are not suitable for me, so either I go for a
Carina or I stick to outfitted hearing devices.)

maari vekki: Some thoughts based on past experience. I have had hearing
aids from the middle 60s to December 2006. I became bilateral DEAF. on
the 20th.
I never considered wearing one then two as much of a problem.
The speed of increasing hearing loss is highly specific to each person.
It is my clear understanding that Cochlear Implants are not comparable
to Hearing aids which only increase sound. Thus one can hear-somewhat.
I have no comment on your understanding that Cochear Implants are
"unsuitable" for you
Does the lack of much comment on Carina here in Alldeaf.com seems " to
uggest" not a widely practiced?

What's wrong with wearing an external aid?

Having worn HA's and now CI they are very different. So different I
just got my 2nd CI.
If the Carina is basically the same as Envoy I'd say approach with
caution. From what I see of the Envoy, you will probably lose the
middle ear conduction system (bones, the device is somehow placed in
there) Plus Envoy is a cash only internal HA (most insurance does not
cover it last I heard). It's also an, if it works you'll love it, but
if it doesn't...........you're probably out a lot of $$
It's an exciting technology and hopefully someday people won't have to
bother with pesky external devices. While this is not a technology that
is of benefit to any in my family at this time because of it's
limitations, it is in my follow and see how it does category.
Just need more people to do it to see how well it really works,
unfortunately unless insurance begins paying for it not enough feed
back will be heard.
